/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the Daily Planner Pro application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * All user-generated data, including subjects, schedules, and tasks, is stored in
 * subcollections under that user's specific document. This creates a secure "data silo"
 * for each user, ensuring that they can only access their own information. The default
 * posture is to deny all access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database is structured hierarchically with a top-level `users` collection. Each user
 * document, identified by their Firebase Authentication UID, serves as a root for their private
 * data: /users/{userId}/subjects/{subjectId}. Schedules and tasks are further nested
 * under their respective subjects.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: Users can only read and write data within their own document tree
 *   (i.e., paths starting with /users/{request.auth.uid}).
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible for any user to list all documents in the top-level
 *   `users` collection, protecting user privacy.
 * - Self-Creation: A newly authenticated user is permitted to create their own user profile
 *   document, but no one else's.
 * - Relational Integrity: To ensure data is correctly associated, rules validate that key
 *   denormalized IDs (like `userId` and `subjectId`) in a document's data match the IDs in
 *   the document's path. This prevents data from being orphaned or linked to the wrong parent.
